abstract = {Abstract Seafloor properties, including total organic carbon (TOC), are sparsely measured on a global scale, and interpolation (prediction) techniques are often used as a proxy for observation. Previous geospatial interpolations of seafloor TOC exhibit gaps where little to no observed data exists. In contrast, recent machine learning techniques, relying on geophysical and geochemical properties (e.g., seafloor biomass, porosity, and distance from coast), show promise in making comprehensive, statistically optimal predictions. Here we apply a nonparametric (i.e., data-driven) machine learning algorithm, specifically k-nearest neighbors (kNN), to estimate the global distribution of seafloor TOC. Our results include predictor (feature) selection specifically designed to mitigate bias and produce a statistically optimal estimation of seafloor TOC, with uncertainty, at 5 × 5-arc minute resolution. Analysis of parameter space sample density provides a guide for future sampling. One use for this prediction is to constrain a global inventory, indicating that just the upper 5 cm of the seafloor contains about 87 ± 43 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) in organic form.},

ABSTRACT={A carbon budget for the northwest European continental shelf seas (NWES) was synthesized using available estimates for coastal, pelagic and benthic carbon stocks and flows. Key uncertainties were identified and the effect of future impacts on the carbon budget were assessed. The water of the shelf seas contains between 210 and 230 Tmol of carbon and absorbs between 1.3 and 3.3 Tmol from the atmosphere annually. Off-shelf transport and burial in the sediments account for 60–100 and 0–40% of carbon outputs from the NWES, respectively. Both of these fluxes remain poorly constrained by observations and resolving their magnitudes and relative importance is a key research priority. Pelagic and benthic carbon stocks are dominated by inorganic carbon. Shelf sediments contain the largest stock of carbon, with between 520 and 1600 Tmol stored in the top 0.1 m of the sea bed. Coastal habitats such as salt marshes and mud flats contain large amounts of carbon per unit area but their total carbon stocks are small compared to pelagic and benthic stocks due to their smaller spatial extent. The large pelagic stock of carbon will continue to increase due to the rising concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, with associated pH decrease. Pelagic carbon stocks and flows are also likely to be significantly affected by increasing acidity and temperature, and circulation changes but the net impact is uncertain. Benthic carbon stocks will be affected by increasing temperature and acidity, and decreasing oxygen concentrations, although the net impact of these interrelated changes on carbon stocks is uncertain and a major knowledge gap. The impact of bottom trawling on benthic carbon stocks is unique amongst the impacts we consider in that it is widespread and also directly manageable, although its net effect on the carbon budget is uncertain. Coastal habitats are vulnerable to sea level rise and are strongly impacted by management decisions. Local, national and regional actions have the potential to protect or enhance carbon storage, but ultimately global governance, via controls on emissions, has the greatest potential to influence the long-term fate of carbon stocks in the northwestern European continental shelf.}

abstract = {The oft-cited general correlation between net sediment accumulation and preservation of organic matter, while revealing in many ways, can be a misleading indicator of general elemental cycling processes and controls on storage of biogenic material at the continental-ocean boundary. Deltaic environments are characterized by the highest rates of net sedimentation and are the single most important class of depocenters on Earth. Available data indicate that sedimentary organic C (Corg) of both terrestrial and marine origin is efficiently decomposed in deltaic areas, with decomposition percentages reaching ≥70% and ≥90%, respectively, the latter percentage (marine) being quite comparable to deep-sea, low sedimentation environments. Despite high primary productivity associated with most deltas and evidence of substantial deposition of fresh planktonic debris, patterns of SO4= reduction indicate that the reactivity of organic material being buried is low, and that a larger proportion of Corg is often degraded compared to other marine deposits of similar net accumulation rate. As indicated by properties of the surficial Amazon delta and downdrift coastal region of northeast South America (∼1600-km extent), the primary reasons for efficient remineralization are related to intense and massive physical reworking of sediment associated with estuarine fronts, upwelling, tidal oscillation, and wind-driven waves. Fluid muds and mobile surface material cause the seafloor and continental boundary to act as a massive, suboxic, fluidized bed reactor dominated in some cases by bacterial rather than macrofaunal biomass. Reoxidation, repetitive redox successions, metabolite exchange, and continual mixing-in of fresh planktonic debris with refractory terrestrial components, result in an efficient decomposition system largely decoupled from net accumulation. Similar processes occur on smaller scales in most estuarine-shelf systems, but appear to be most dramatically expressed off the major rivers forming deltas.}

abstract={By analogy with the present-day ocean, the primary productivity of paleoceans can be reconstructed using calculations based on the content of organic carbon in sediments and their accumulation rates. Results of calculations based on literature data show that the primary productivity of organic carbon, the mass of phosphorus involved in the process, and the content of phosphorus in oceanic waters were relatively stable in the Mesozoic and Late Mesozoic. Prior to precipitation on the seafloor together with the biogenic detritus, the dissolved phosphorus could repeatedly be involved in the biogeochemical cycle. Therefore, only less than 0.1{\%} of phosphorus is retained in bottom sediments. The bulk phosphorus accumulation rate in oceanic sediments is partly consistent with the calculated primary productivity. Some epochs of phosphate accumulation also coincide with maximums of primary productivity and minimums of the fossilization coefficient of organic carbon. The latter fact can testify to episodes of the acceleration of organic matter mineralization and the release of phosphorus from sediments, leading to increase in the phosphorus reserve in paleoceans and phosphate accumulation in some places.},

title = {Burial of organic carbon and pyrite sulfur in the modern ocean: its geochemical and environmental significance},
author = {Berner, R A},
abstractNote = {It is possible to estimate the present-day rate of burial of organic carbon in marine sediments from a knowledge of the suspended load carried by rivers and the organic carbon content of resultant deltaic-shelf sediments. This is done here for a number of the world's major rivers. Extrapolation of results to all remaining rivers indicates that the total burial rate of organic carbon in shelf-deltaic muds is 130 Mt (megatons = 10/sup 12/ gm) of carbon per y. This value is decidedly lower than the rate by which organic carbon is added to the oceans by rivers, which indicates that continentally-derived organic matter must undergo appreciable biological decomposition in the marine environment. The low carbon burial also indicates that much less than 10 percent of the missing anthropogenic CO/sub 2/ produced over the past 100 yrs is present as organic carbon in marine sediments. The average organic carbon concentration calculated from this data for modern terrigenous muds is lower than that found for ancient shales, and this can be best explained in terms of dilution of carbon in modern sediments by excess river-borne mineral matter resulting from man-induced soil erosion or Pleistocene continental glaciation. The worldwide burial rate of pyritic sulfur in marine sediments, 39 Mt S per y, is obtained by dividing the organic carbon burial rate in anoxic, terrigenous, fine-grained sediments by the constant ratio of C/S found, at depth, in such sediments. The average concentration of pyrite sulfur in modern muds (0.22 percent) is somewhat lower than that estimated for ancient shales (0.35 percent), and this can be best explained in terms of dilution of the sulfur in modern muds by river-borne silicate mineral matter, from glaciation or soil erosion, in the same manner as hypothesized for organic carbon.},

Presented herein is a global map of predicted modern (postindustrial, 20th and 21st century) oceanic mass accumulation rates of 5-arc-minute pitch and in log10-space, trained on observed marine mass accumulation rates from 43 peer reviewed sources (n = 1744) and predicted using a k-nearest neighbor geospatial algorithm. The resultant model predicts ~3.3 × 104 Mt. yr−1 of sediment accumulating onto the sea floor (R2 = 0.88). Most sediment accumulates proximal to major river outlets and deltas. Continental regions with the highest sediment accumulation are Asia and Oceania. This model is the first of its kind to predict the rate and quantity of sediment accumulating on to the ocean floor, globally, using decades of regional real-world observations. The generated global map of modern, benthic mass accumulation rates also serves to highlight areas of interest for future study in related fields, such as sediment dynamics and seafloor stability.}

In this study, we present a new approach to regionalize the total organic carbon (TOC) content in surface sediments (<5cm sediment depth). It is based on a compilation of more than 5500 single measurements from various sources. Global TOC distribution was determined by the application of a combined qualitative and quantitative-geostatistical method. Overall, 33 benthic TOC-based provinces were defined and used to process the global distribution pattern of the TOC content in surface sediments in a 1°×1° grid resolution. Regional dependencies of data points within each single province are expressed by modeled semi-variograms. Measured and estimated TOC values show good correlation, emphasizing the reasonable applicability of the method. The accumulation of organic carbon in marine surface sediments is a key parameter in the control of mineralization processes and the material exchange between the sediment and the ocean water. Our approach will help to improve global budgets of nutrient and carbon cycles.}

We show here how porosity everywhere at the seafloor can be estimated using a machine learning technique (specifically, Random Forests). Such techniques use sparsely acquired direct samples and dense grids of other parameters to produce a statistically optimal estimate where direct measurements are lacking. Our porosity estimate is both qualitatively more consistent with geologic principles than the results produced by interpolation and quantitatively more accurate than results produced by interpolation or regression methods. We present here a seafloor porosity estimate on a 5 arc min, pixel registered grid, produced using widely available, densely sampled grids of other seafloor properties. These techniques represent the only practical means of estimating seafloor properties in inaccessible regions of the seafloor (e.g., the Arctic).},

ABSTRACT={To develop more accurate global carbon (C) budgets and to better inform management of human activities in the ocean, we need high-resolution estimates of marine C stocks. Here we quantify global marine sedimentary C stocks at a 1-km resolution, and find that marine sediments store 2322 (2239–2391) Pg C in the top 1 m (nearly twice that of terrestrial soils). Sediments in abyss/basin zones account for 79% of the global marine sediment C stock, and 49% of that stock is within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones of countries. Currently, only ∼2% of sediment C stocks are located in highly to fully protected areas that prevent the disturbance of the seafloor. Our results show that marine sediments represent a large and globally important C sink. However, the lack of protection for marine C stocks makes them highly vulnerable to human disturbances that can lead to their remineralization to CO<sub>2</sub>, further aggravating climate change impacts.}

abstract={The ocean contains unique biodiversity, provides valuable food resources and is a major sink for anthropogenic carbon. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an effective tool for restoring ocean biodiversity and ecosystem services1,2, but at present only 2.7{\%} of the ocean is highly protected3. This low level of ocean protection is due largely to conflicts with fisheries and other extractive uses. To address this issue, here we developed a conservation planning framework to prioritize highly protected MPAs in places that would result in multiple benefits today and in the future. We find that a substantial increase in ocean protection could have triple benefits, by protecting biodiversity, boosting the yield of fisheries and securing marine carbon stocks that are at risk from human activities. Our results show that most coastal nations contain priority areas that can contribute substantially to achieving these three objectives of biodiversity protection, food provision and carbon storage. A globally coordinated effort could be nearly twice as efficient as uncoordinated, national-level conservation planning. Our flexible prioritization framework could help to inform both national marine spatial plans4 and global targets for marine conservation, food security and climate action.},

abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

abstract={Observed vertical sediment accumulation rates (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1031) were gathered from {\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}55 years of peer reviewed literature. Original methods of rate calculation include long-term isotope geochronology (14C, 210Pb, and 137Cs), pollen analysis, horizon markers, and box coring. These observations are used to create a database of global, contemporary vertical sediment accumulation rates. Rates were converted to cm year−1, paired with the observation's longitude and latitude, and placed into a machine learning--based Global Predictive Seabed Model (GPSM). GPSM finds correlations between the data and established global ``predictors'' (quantities known or estimable everywhere, e.g., distance from coastline and river mouths). The result, using a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm, is a 5-arc-minute global map of predicted benthic vertical sediment accumulation rates. The map generated provides a global reference for vertical sedimentation from coastal to abyssal depths. Areas of highest sedimentation, {\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}3--8 cm year−1, are generally river mouth proximal coastal zones draining relatively large areas with high maximum elevations and with wide, shallow continental shelves (e.g., the Gulf of Mexico and the Amazon Delta), with rates falling exponentially towards the deepest parts of the oceans. The exception is Oceania, which displays significant vertical sedimentation over a large area without draining the large drainage basins seen in other regions. Coastal zones with relatively small drainage basins and steep shelves display vertical sedimentation of {\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}1 cm year−1, which is limited to the near shore when compared with shallow, wide margins (e.g., the western coasts of North and South America). Abyssal depth rates are functionally zero at the time scale examined ({\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}10−4 cm year−1) and increase one order of magnitude near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and at the Galapagos Triple Junction.},

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs – extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.}

abstract = {Quantifying the rates of biogeochemical processes in marine sediments is essential for understanding global element cycles and climate change. Because organic matter degradation is the engine behind benthic dynamics, deciphering the impact that various forces have on this process is central to determining the evolution of the Earth system. Therefore, recent developments in the quantitative modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are critically reviewed. The first part of the review synthesizes the main chemical, biological and physical factors that control organic matter degradation in sediments while the second part provides a general review of the mathematical formulations used to model these processes and the third part evaluates their application over different spatial and temporal scales. Key transport mechanisms in sedimentary environments are summarized and the mathematical formulation of the organic matter degradation rate law is described in detail. The roles of enzyme kinetics, bioenergetics, temperature and biomass growth in particular are highlighted. Alternative model approaches that quantify the degradation rate constant are also critically compared. In the third part of the review, the capability of different model approaches to extrapolate organic matter degradation rates over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales is assessed. In addition, the structure, functions and parameterization of more than 250 published models of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are analyzed. The large range of published model parameters illustrates the complex nature of organic matter dynamics, and, thus, the limited transferability of these parameters from one site to another. Compiled model parameters do not reveal a statistically significant correlation with single environmental characteristics such as water depth, deposition rate or organic matter flux. The lack of a generic framework that allows for model parameters to be constrained in data-poor areas seriously limits the quantification of organic matter degradation on a global scale. Therefore, we explore regional patterns that emerge from the compiled more than 250 organic matter rate constants and critically discuss them in their environmental context. This review provides an interdisciplinary view on organic matter degradation in marine sediments. It contributes to an improved understanding of global patterns in benthic organic matter degradation, and helps identify outstanding questions and future directions in the modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments.}

Although much has been learned about the factors that promote and hinder rates of organic carbon degradation in natural systems, the controls on the distribution of organic carbon in modern and ancient sediments are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize how recent findings are changing entrenched perspectives on organic matter degradation in marine sediments: a shift from a structurally-based chemical reactivity viewpoint towards an emerging acceptance of the role of the ecosystem in organic matter degradation rates. That is, organic carbon has a range of reactivities determined by not only the nature of the organic compounds, but by the biological, geochemical, and physical attributes of its environment. This shift in mindset has gradually come about due to a greater diversity of sample sites, the molecular revolution in biology, discoveries concerning the extent and limits of life, advances in quantitative modeling, investigations of ocean carbon cycling under a variety of extreme paleo-conditions (e.g. greenhouse environments, euxinic/anoxic oceans), the application of novel analytical techniques and interdisciplinary efforts. Adopting this view across scientific disciplines will enable additional progress in understanding how marine sediments influence the global carbon cycle.}

These two underappreciated observations have important implications in terms of our understanding of the controls on the global carbon cycle.

    abstract = "{The organic subcycle of the long-term carbon cycle, where organic matter burial and weathering are involved, constitutes the major control on the evolution of atmospheric oxygen. It is also important as a secondary factor affecting atmospheric CO2. Thus, it is important to better understand the processes whereby organic matter is buried in sediments and oxidized upon subsequent exposure to weathering during uplift onto the continents. This is especially true of the Paleozoic rise of land plants, which had a large effect on atmospheric CO2 because of increased global organic burial due to the addition of plant debris to sediments. The burial of organic matter in marine sediments is impacted strongly by the availability of the nutrient elements, phosphorus and nitrogen, so a complete discussion of the cycling of organic carbon should involve some discussion of the cycles of these elements. Carbonate burial is the ultimate sink for CO2 derived from the atmosphere via the weathering of Ca and Mg silicates. The location of this burial, shallow water shelves versus the deep sea floor, is important because it affects the probability that the carbonate will be eventually thermally recycled and the carbon returned to the atmosphere. Carbonate weathering is the dominant process affecting river water composition and is a key component of the cycling of carbon. Its importance to the long-term carbon cycle is that, in order to calculate the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere via Ca and Mg silicate weathering, it is necessary to correct total carbonate burial for that derived from carbonate weathering. At present, sedimentary organic matter burial occurs in swamps, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, and in the open marine environment. The ultimate sources of the organics are land vegetation and marine phytoplankton. Also, soil organic matter, which is intimately associated with clay minerals, is eroded and transported to the sea by rivers (Hedges et al., 1994). A major question is how much of the total global burial is of marine or nonmarine origin. Recent work has shown that organic burial on land is much higher than previously recognized, especially as a result of human activities (Dean and Gorham, 1998; Stallard, 1998). }",

abstract = {Throughout Earth history, almost all preserved organic matter has been incorporated in marine sediments deposited under oxygenated waters along continental margins. Given modern oceanic productivity and sediment burial rates of 50 × 1015 and 0.16 × 1015 gC yr−1, respectively, organic preservation in the marine environment is < 0.5% efficient. Although correlative information is often used to suggest that productivity, sediment accumulation rate, bottom water oxicity, and organic matter source are key variables, the mechanisms governing sedimentary organic matter preservation have remained unclear. The factors which directly determine preservation vary with depositional regime, but have in common a critical interaction between organic and inorganic materials over locally variable time scales. More than 90% of total sedimentary organic matter from a wide variety of marine depositional environments cannot be physically separated from its mineral matrix. This strongly associated organic component varies directly in concentration with sediment surface area and thus appears to be sorbed to mineral grains. Sediments accumulating outside deltas along continental shelves and upper slopes characteristically exhibit mineral surface area loadings approximately equivalent to a single molecular covering. These monolayer-equivalent coatings include a fraction of reversibly bound organic molecules that are intrinsically labile, but resist appreciable mineralization as they pass rapidly through oxygenated surface sediments and are preserved within underlying anoxic deposits. The delivery of mineral surface area is the primary control on organic matter preservation within these expansive coastal margin regions where roughly 45% of all organic carbon accumulates. Deltaic sediments account for roughly another 45% of global carbon burial, but often exhibit much less than monolayer-equivalent organic coatings. This pattern is seen in periodically oxygenated sediments off the mouth of the Amazon River, even though the component clastic minerals are discharged by the river with monolayer coatings. Comparably extensive losses of organic matter, including distinct particles such as pollen grains, occur in the surfaces of deep-sea turbidites in which long term reaction with O2 is clearly the causative factor. Sub-monolayer organic coatings also are observed in continental rise and abyssal plain sediments where slower accumulation rates and deeper O2 penetration depths result in increased oxygen exposure times and little (~ 5% of the global total) organic matter preservation. A transition zone between monolayer and sub-monolayer organic coatings apparently occurs on lower continental slopes, and is marked along the Washington coast by parallel offshore decreases in total organic matter and pollen between 2000–3000 m water depth. Sediments underlying highly productive, low-oxygen coastal waters such as off Peru and western Mexico are characteristically rich in organic matter, but account for only ~ 5% of total organic carbon burial. These sediments show a direct relationship between organic matter content and mineral surface area, but at organic loadings 2–5 times a monolayer equivalent. Organic materials sorbed in excess of a monolayer thus also may be partially protected. Such high sedimentary organic contents may result from equilibration with DOM-rich porewaters, or very brief O2 exposure times which allow preservation of extremely oxygen-sensitive organic materials such as pigments and unsaturated lipids. Thus organic matter preservation throughout much of the ocean may be controlled largely by competition between sorption at different protective thresholds and oxic degradation. Future research strategies should be specifically directed at delineating the mechanisms for organic matter preservation in marine sediments. In particular, special effort is needed to determine the amounts and types of sorbed organic materials and the nature of their bonding to mineral surfaces. The extent and dynamics with which organic molecules are partitioned between porewaters and solid phases also should be determined, as well as the effects of these phase associations on their reactivities toward chemical and biological agents. In addition, processes for slow oxic (and suboxic) degradation of organic materials bear investigation in deep-sea sediments, as well as in other extreme environments such as oxidizing turbidites, weathering shales, and soils. Such studies should include characterizations of hydrolysis-resistant organic materials and emphasize the complementary use of biochemical compositions with readily separable particles such as pollen to calibrate and typify the mechanisms and stages of sedimentary organic degradation.}

abstract = {Abstract We report on the geochemistry of hydrocarbons and pore waters down to 62.5 mbsf, collected by drilling with the MARUM-MeBo70 and by gravity coring at the Lunde pockmark in the Vestnesa Ridge. Our data document the origin and transformations of volatiles feeding gas emissions previously documented in this region. Gas hydrates are present where a fracture network beneath the pockmark focusses migration of thermogenic hydrocarbons characterized by their C1/C2+ and stable isotopic compositions (δ2H-CH4, δ13C-CH4). Measured geothermal gradients (~80 °C/km) and known formation temperatures (>70 °C) suggest that those hydrocarbons are formed at depths >800 mbsf. A combined analytical/modeling approach, including concentration and isotopic mass balances, reveals that pockmark sediments experience diffuse migration of thermogenic hydrocarbons. However, at sites without channeled flow this appears to be limited to depths >~50 mbsf. At all sites we document a contribution of microbial methanogenesis to the overall carbon cycle that includes a component of secondary carbonate reduction—that is, reduction of dissolved inorganic carbon generated by anaerobic oxidation of methane in the uppermost methanogenic zone. Anaerobic oxidation of methane and carbonate reduction rates are spatially variable within the pockmark and are highest at high-flux sites. These reactions are revealed by 13C depletions of dissolved inorganic carbon at the sulfate-methane interface at all sites. However, 13C depletions of CH4 are only observed at the low methane flux sites because changes in the isotopic composition of the overall methane pool are masked at high-flux sites. 13C depletions of total organic carbon suggest that at seeps sites, methane-derived carbon is incorporated into de novo synthesized biomass.},

abstract = {Evidence shows that habitats with potential to mitigate against greenhouse gases emissions, by taking up and storing CO2, are being lost due to the effects of on-going human activities and climate change. The carbon storage by terrestrial habitats (e.g. tropical forests) and the role of coastal habitats (‘Blue Carbon’) as carbon storage sinks is well recognised. Offshore shelf sediments are also a manageable carbon store, covering ∼9% of global marine area, but not currently protected by international agreements to enable their conservation. Through a scenario analysis, we explore the economic value of the damage of human activities and climate change can inflict on UK marine habitats, including shelf sea sediments. In a scenario of increased human and climate pressures over a 25-year period, we estimate damage costs up to US$12.5 billion from carbon release linked to disturbance of coastal and shelf sea sediment carbon stores. It may be possible to manage socio-economic pressure to maintain sedimentary carbon storage, but the trade-offs with other global social welfare benefits such as food security will have to be taken into account. To develop effective incentive mechanisms to preserve these valuable coastal and marine ecosystems within a sustainability governance framework, robust evidence is required.}

ABSTRACT = {The accumulation of methane hydrate in marine sediments is controlled by a number of physical and biogeochemical parameters including the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), the solubility of methane in pore fluids, the accumulation of particulate organic carbon at the seafloor, the kinetics of microbial organic matter degradation and methane generation in marine sediments, sediment compaction and the ascent of deep-seated pore fluids and methane gas into the GHSZ. Our present knowledge on these controlling factors is discussed and new estimates of global sediment and methane fluxes are provided applying a transport-reaction model at global scale. The modeling and the data evaluation yield improved and better constrained estimates of the global pore volume within the modern GHSZ ( ≥ 44 × 1015 m3), the Holocene POC accumulation rate at the seabed (~1.4 × 1014 g yr−1), the global rate of microbial methane production in the deep biosphere (4−25 × 1012 g C yr−1) and the inventory of methane hydrates in marine sediments ( ≥ 455 Gt of methane-bound carbon).},

These models require initialization with realistic three- dimensional (3-D) oceanic carbon fields. This report presents an approach to establishing these initial conditions from an extensive global database of ocean carbon dioxide (CO2) system measurements and well-developed interpolation methods. These methods are limited to waters below the deepest mixed layer. The data used for these interpolations include the recent high-quality data sets from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), and Ocean-Atmosphere Carbon Exchange Study (OACES) programs. Prior to analysis, all carbon data were adjusted to established reference material listed in http://andrew.ucsd.edu/co2qc/. The interpolation methodology employs correlation between CO2 system properties and other more widely measured properties: potential temperature, salinity, and apparent oxygen utilization. The correlations are computed for each profile, and the coefficients are interpolated to the 1{\textdegree}{\texttimes}1{\textdegree}{\texttimes}32 vertical-layer grid at a monthly temporal resolution. Finally, the gridded coefficients are applied to a global monthly climatology of ocean temperature, salinity, and oxygen to compute total CO2 (TCO2) and total alkalinity (TALK) for the 3-D grid. This approach offers advantages over spin up of a single profile in defining spatial variation in CO2 system properties because it reduces initialization time and provides a more accurate carbon field. The results provide an unprecedented "view" of the global distribution of TALK and TCO2 in the ocean. These results as well as those from the monthly mixed layer depths can be used in diagnostic and prognostic global ocean models. The data set of the gridded climatological fields of TCO2, TALK, and mixed layer depths is available free of charge as a numeric data package from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC). The interpolated data set includes seasonal TCO2 and TALK fields as well as the coefficients used to estimate these concentrations and the monthly mixed layer depths.},

However, it is not known to what depth microorganisms alter organic carbon in marine sediments or how microbial rates of organic carbon processing change with depth, and thus time since burial, on a global scale. To better understand the connection between the dynamic carbon cycle and life’s limits in the deep subsurface, we have combined a number of global data sets with a reaction transport model (RTM) describing first, organic carbon degradation in marine sediments deposited throughout the Quaternary Period and second, a bioenergetic model for microbial activity. The RTM is applied globally, recognizing three distinct depositional environments – continental shelf, margin and abyssal zones. The results include the masses of particulate organic carbon, POC, stored in three sediment-depth layers: bioturbated Holocene (1.7 × 1017 g C), non-bioturbated Holocene (2.5 × 1018 g C) and Pleistocene (1.4 × 1020 g C) sediments. The global depth-integrated rates of POC degradation have been determined to be 1.3 × 1015, 1.3 × 1014 and 3.0 × 1014 g C yr−1 for the same three layers, respectively. A number of maps depicting the distribution of POC, as well as the fraction that has been degraded have also been generated. Using POC degradation as a proxy for microbial catabolic activity, total heterotrophic processing of POC throughout the Quaternary is estimated to be between 10−11 and 10−6 g C cm−3 yr−1, depending on the time since deposition and location. Bioenergetic modeling reveals that laboratory-determined microbial maintenance powers are poor predictors of sediment biomass concentration, but that cell concentrations in marine sediments can be accurately predicted by combining bioenergetic models with the rates of POC degradation determined in this study. Our model can be used to quantitatively describe both the carbon cycle and microbial activity on a global scale for marine sediments less than 2.59 million years old.}

Although much has been learned about the factors that promote and hinder rates of organic carbon degradation in natural systems, the controls on the distribution of organic carbon in modern and ancient sediments are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize how recent findings are changing entrenched perspectives on organic matter degradation in marine sediments: a shift from a structurally-based chemical reactivity viewpoint towards an emerging acceptance of the role of the ecosystem in organic matter degradation rates. That is, organic carbon has a range of reactivities determined by not only the nature of the organic compounds, but by the biological, geochemical, and physical attributes of its environment. This shift in mindset has gradually come about due to a greater diversity of sample sites, the molecular revolution in biology, discoveries concerning the extent and limits of life, advances in quantitative modeling, investigations of ocean carbon cycling under a variety of extreme paleo-conditions (e.g. greenhouse environments, euxinic/anoxic oceans), the application of novel analytical techniques and interdisciplinary efforts. Adopting this view across scientific disciplines will enable additional progress in understanding how marine sediments influence the global carbon cycle.}

abstract = {The seabed plays a key role in the marine carbon cycle as a) the terminal location of aerobic oxidation of organic matter, b) the greatest anaerobic bioreactor, and c) the greatest repository for reactive organic carbon on Earth. We compiled data on the oxygen uptake of marine sediments with the objective to understand the constraints on mineralization rates of deposited organic matter and their relation to key environmental parameters. The compiled database includes nearly 4000 O2 uptake data and is available as supplementary material. It includes also information on bottom water O2 concentration, O2 penetration depth, geographic position, water depth, and full information on the data sources. We present the different in situ and ex situ approaches to measure the total oxygen uptake (TOU) and the diffusive oxygen uptake (DOU) of sediments and discuss their robustness towards methodological errors and statistical uncertainty. We discuss O2 transport through the benthic and diffusive boundary layers, the diffusion- and fauna-mediated O2 uptake, and the coupling of aerobic respiration to anaerobic processes. Five regional examples are presented to illustrate the diversity of the seabed: Eutrophic seas, oxygen minimum zones, abyssal plains, mid-oceanic gyres, and hadal trenches. A multiple correlation analysis shows that seabed O2 uptake is primarily controlled by ocean depth and sea surface primary productivity. The O2 penetration depth scales with the DOU according to a power law that breaks down under the abyssal ocean gyres. The developed multiple correlation model was used to draw a global map of seabed O2 uptake rates. Respiratory coefficients, differentiated for depth regions of the ocean, were used to convert the global O2 uptake to organic carbon oxidation. The resulting global budget shows an oxidation of 212 Tmol C yr−1 in marine sediments with a 5-95% confidence interval of 175-260 Tmol C yr−1. A comparison with the global flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) from photic surface waters to the deep sea, determined from multiple sediment trap studies, suggests a deficit in the sedimentation flux at 2000 m water depth of about 70% relative to the carbon turnover in the underlying seabed. At the ocean margins, the flux of organic carbon from rivers and from vegetated coastal ecosystems contributes greatly to the budget and may even exceed the phytoplankton production on the inner continental shelf.}

ABSTRACT={Continental shelf sediments are recognized as long-term stores of globally significant quantities of carbon (C) and potentially provide an important, yet largely overlooked climate regulation service via the Earth’s C cycle. Current understanding of the spatial distribution of sedimentary C across continental shelves remains poor, inhibiting the targeted management and potential inclusion of these globally significant C stores into national C budgets. Further understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of continental shelf sediments and associated C provides a foundation to quantify the organic carbon (OC) stock and better understand the role that marine sediments play in regulating the global climate and the potential for CO<sub>2</sub> to be released through anthropogenic disturbance of these C stores. Utilizing a spectrum of available marine data, we have created bespoke sediment maps that quantify the surficial (top 10 cm) OC stock and highlight significant spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of sediments and their associated C content across the United Kingdom’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The surficial sediments within the UK EEZ are estimated to store 524 ± 68 Mt of organic carbon (OC) and 2,582 ± 168 Mt of inorganic carbon (IC). The spatial mapping of this C highlights well-defined OC accumulation hotspots in fjords, estuaries and coastal muds, while large accumulations of IC are found in the tidally swept areas around Orkney, Shetland and the South West of England. Within the well-defined OC hotspots, muddy sediments store the greatest quantity of OC; the muds offer potentially valuable opportunities for targeted future management and protection of sedimentary C stores within the UK EEZ. In the future, if areas of the seafloor were to be managed to include the protection of these valuable sedimentary C resources, we recommend an initial focus on hotspots of high sedimentary OC density.}

ABSTRACT={<p>Marine sediments comprise one of the largest microbial habitats and organic carbon sinks on the planet. However, it is unclear how variations in sediment physicochemical properties impact microorganisms on a global scale. Here we investigate patterns in the distribution of microbial cells, organic carbon, and the amounts of power used by microorganisms in global sediments. Our results show that sediment on continental shelves and margins is predominantly anoxic and contains cells whose power utilization decreases with sediment depth and age. Sediment in abyssal zones contains microbes that use low amounts of power on a per cell basis, across large gradients in sediment depth and age. We find that trends in cell abundance, POC storage and degradation, and microbial power utilization are mainly structured by depositional setting and redox conditions, rather than sediment depth and age. We also reveal distinct trends in per-cell power regime across different depositional settings, from maxima of ∼10<sup>–16</sup> W cell<sup>–1</sup> in recently deposited shelf sediments to minima of &lt;10<sup>–20</sup> W cell<sup>–1</sup> in deeper and ancient sediments. Overall, we demonstrate broad global-scale connections between the depositional setting and redox conditions of global sediment, and the amounts of organic carbon and activity of deep biosphere microorganisms.</p>}}

abstract = {The organic matter that escapes decomposition is buried and preserved in marine sediments, with much debate as to whether the amount depends on bottom-water O2 concentration. One group argues that decomposition is more efficient with O2, and hence, organic carbon will be preferentially oxidized in its presence, and preserved in its absence. Another group argues that the kinetics of organic matter decomposition are similar in the presence and absence of O2, and there should be no influence of O2 on preservation. A compilation of carbon preservation shows that both groups are right, depending on the circumstances of deposition. At high rates of deposition, such as near continental margins, little difference in preservation is found with varying bottom-water O2. It is important that most carbon in these sediments decomposes by anaerobic pathways regardless of bottom-water O2. Hence, little influence of bottom-water O2 on preservation would, in fact, be expected. As sedimentation rate drops, sediments deposited under oxygenated bottom water become progressively more aerobic, while euxinic sediments remain anaerobic. Under these circumstances, the relative efficiencies of aerobic and anaerobic decomposition could affect preservation. Indeed, enhanced preservation is observed in low-O2 and euxinic environments. To explore in detail the factors contributing to this enhanced carbon preservation, aspects of the biochemistries of the aerobic and anaerobic process are reviewed. Other potential influences on preservation are also explored. Finally, a new model for organic carbon decomposition, the “pseudo-G” model, is developed. This model couples the degradation of refractory organic matter to the overall metabolic activity of the sediment, and has consequences for carbon preservation due to the mixing together of labile and refractory organic matter by bioturbation.}

  abstract = {A Bayesian model of learning to learn by sampling from multiple tasks is presented. The multiple tasks are themselves generated by sampling from a distribution over an environment of related tasks. Such an environment is shown to be naturally modelled within a Bayesian context by the concept of an objective prior distribution. It is argued that for many common machine learning problems, although in general we do not know the true (objective) prior for the problem, we do have some idea of a set of possible priors to which the true prior belongs. It is shown that under these circumstances a learner can use Bayesian inference to learn the true prior by learning sufficiently many tasks from the environment. In addition, bounds are given on the amount of information required to learn a task when it is simultaneously learnt with several other tasks. The bounds show that if the learner has little knowledge of the true prior, but the dimensionality of the true prior is small, then sampling multiple tasks is highly advantageous. The theory is applied to the problem of learning a common feature set or equivalently a low-dimensional-representation (LDR) for an environment of related tasks.},

 abstract = {Continental shelf benthic ecosystems play an important role in the economy of many coastal states through the provision of food, non-living resources and through control of climate. Changes in the status of these ecosystems, through either natural or humaninduced environmental drivers can be expected to have important economic and social consequences. Agents that could induce change include climate and oceanography, hydrology (river discharge), land-use and waste disposal practices, fishing, aquaculture and extraction of non-living resources. Trends in all of these drivers, particularly those under human influence, suggest that shelf systems will come under increasing pressure. Attempts to predict the future state of any ecological system are fraught with difficulty, particularly over decadal time-frames. This is, perhaps, especially true for continental shelf ecosystems where data on current status are poor and our understanding of many of the drivers of change somewhat rudimentary. What can be said for certain, however, is that change will occur and, in the short term, many of the signs point towards deterioration in the ecological condition of many shelf systems, but particularly those of developing countries. Trends in land-use practices, with consequences for nutrient, sediment and freshwater input to coastal seas appear to be particularly worrying, but the poor state of many demersal fisheries systems must also be acknowledged. In contrast to the developing world, although challenges undoubtedly remain, particularly with respect to atmospheric inputs resulting from energy production, current trends in environmental management suggest that pressures imposed by land use, waste disposal and fishing will probably decline over the coming decades on the shelves of many developed countries. At the global scale, therefore, the key driver for sustainable use of our continental shelf ecosystems would appear to be intimately linked to the social and economic well-being of poorer nations.},

abstract = {On geological time-scales, the production and degree of recycling of biogenic carbon in the marine realm and ultimately its removal to sediments, exerts a dominant control on atmospheric CO2 and hence variability in climate. This is a highly complex system involving a myriad of inter-connected biological, chemical, and physical processes. For this reason alone, linking observations, often highly abstracted in the form of proxies, to the primary processes involved and ultimately to explanatory hypotheses for specific geological events and transitions, is challenging. The past few decades have seen a progressive improvement in theoretical and process-based understanding of the various components that make up the marine carbon cycle and, hand-in-hand with this, the development of numerical model representations of the complete system. Models have also been designed and/or adapted with paleoclimate questions in mind and applied to quantitatively explore the role of the marine carbon cycle in both perturbations and long-term geologic evolutionary trends in global climate, and possible feedbacks between them. However, we must ask whether paleoclimate models incorporate sufficiently appropriate representations of the dynamics and sensitivities of the marine carbon cycle, and indeed, whether in the geological context, we really know what these dynamics are. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of how marine carbon cycling and the biological carbon pump is treated in available paleoclimate models, with the aim of critically evaluating their ability to help interpret past marine carbon cycle and climate dynamics. To this end, we first provide an overview of commonly used paleoclimate models and some of their associated paleo-applications, drawing from a wide range of global carbon cycle box models and Earth system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs). Secondly, we review and evaluate the three dominant processes involved in the cycling of organic and inorganic carbon in the marine system and how they are represented in models, namely: biological productivity at the ocean surface, remineralisation/dissolution of particulate carbon within the water column, and the benthic-pelagic coupling at the seafloor. We generate and employ illustrative examples using the model GENIE to show how different parameterisations of water-column and sediment processes can lead to significantly different model projections. Our compilation reveals the prevalence of static parameterisations of marine carbon cycling among existing paleoclimate models, which are commonly empirically derived from present-day observations. Although such approaches tend to represent carbon transfer in the modern ocean well, they are potentially compromised in their ability to reflect the true degree of freedom and strength of feedbacks with respect to past climate events, particularly those characterised by environmental boundary conditions that differ fundamentally from today. Finally, we discuss the importance of using models of different complexities and how questions of model uncertainty may start to be addressed.}

abstract = {Abstract Fishing affects the seabed habitat worldwide on the continental shelf. These impacts are patchily distributed according to the spatial and temporal variation in fishing effort that results from fishers' behaviour. As a consequence, the frequency and intensity of fishing disturbance varies among different habitat types. Different fishing methodologies vary in the degree to which they affect the seabed. Structurally complex habitats (e.g. seagrass meadows, biogenic reefs) and those that are relatively undisturbed by natural perturbations (e.g. deep-water mud substrata) are more adversely affected by fishing than unconsolidated sediment habitats that occur in shallow coastal waters. These habitats also have the longest recovery trajectories in terms of the recolonization of the habitat by the associated fauna. Comparative studies of areas of the seabed that have experienced different levels of fishing activity demonstrate that chronic fishing disturbance leads to the removal of high-biomass species that are composed mostly of emergent seabed organisms. Contrary to the belief of fishers that fishing enhances seabed production and generates food for target fish species, productivity is actually lowered as fishing intensity increases and high-biomass species are removed from the benthic habitat. These organisms also increase the topographic complexity of the seabed which has been shown to provide shelter for juvenile fishes, reducing their vulnerability to predation. Conversely, scavengers and small-bodied organisms, such as polychaete worms, dominate heavily fished areas. Major changes in habitat can lead to changes in the composition of the resident fish fauna. Fishing has indirect effects on habitat through the removal of predators that control bio-engineering organisms such as algal-grazing urchins. Fishing gear resuspend the upper layers of sedimentary seabed habitats and hence remobilize contaminants and fine particulate matter into the water column. The ecological significance of these fishing effects has not yet been determined but could have implications for eutrophication and biogeochemical cycling. Simulation results suggest that the effects of low levels of trawling disturbance will be similar to those of natural bioturbators. In contrast, high levels of trawling disturbance cause sediment systems to become unstable due to large carbon fluxes between oxic and anoxic carbon compartments. In low energy habitats, intensive trawling disturbance may destabilize benthic system chemical fluxes, which has the potential to propagate more widely through the marine ecosystem. Management regimes that aim to incorporate both fisheries and habitat conservation objectives can be achieved through the appropriate use of a number of approaches, including total and partial exclusion of towed bottom fishing gears, and seasonal and rotational closure techniques. However, the inappropriate use of closed areas may displace fishing activities into habitats that are more vulnerable to disturbance than those currently trawled by fishers. In many cases, the behaviour of fishers constrains the extent of the impact of their fishing activities. Management actions that force them to redistribute their effort may be more damaging in the longer term.},

To provide a practical perspective, we present empirical results on both real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that this effect can occur for as few as 10--15 dimensions.",

abstract = {High dimensionality can pose severe difficulties, widely recognized as different aspects of the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we study a new aspect of the curse pertaining to the distribution of k-occurrences, i.e., the number of times a point appears among the k nearest neighbors of other points in a data set. We show that, as dimensionality increases, this distribution becomes considerably skewed and hub points emerge (points with very high k-occurrences). We examine the origin of this phenomenon, showing that it is an inherent property of high-dimensional vector space, and explore its influence on applications based on measuring distances in vector spaces, notably classification, clustering, and information retrieval.},

abstract={Utilization and exploitation of marine resources by humans have contributed to the growth of marine research. As technology progresses, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are progressively being applied to maritime research, complementing traditional marine forecasting models and observation techniques to some degree. This article takes the artificial intelligence algorithmic model as its starting point, references several application trials, and methodically elaborates on the emerging research trend of mixing machine learning and physical modeling concepts. This article discusses the evolution of methodologies for the building of ocean observations, the application of artificial intelligence to remote sensing satellites, smart sensors, and intelligent underwater robots, and the construction of ocean big data. We also cover the method of identifying internal waves (IW), heatwaves, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and sea ice using artificial intelligence algorithms. In addition, we analyze the applications of artificial intelligence models in the prediction of ocean components, including physics-driven numerical models, model-driven statistical models, traditional machine learning models, data-driven deep learning models, and physical models combined with artificial intelligence models. This review shows the growth routes of the application of artificial intelligence in ocean observation, ocean phenomena identification, and ocean elements forecasting, with examples and forecasts of their future development trends from several angles and points of view, by categorizing the various uses of artificial intelligence in the ocean sector.}
